# Septimus-Extended---NPC Dialogue Addon (WIP)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integration various mods designed to expand NPC dialogue into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide.

A **NEW SAVE is strongly recommended**. If installing on an existing save, please be sure you have no followers present (modded and/or vanilla), and you have NOT started the Dawnguard questline, 

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - NPC DIALOGUE**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **below all of the Septimus patches**.

**WARNING** - Underwhelming Multiple Followers is more of an AI expansion rather than a dialogue expansion, but I have included it as an optional file for those who are interested in utilizing a multiple follower framework. It's a mod that **should not not be uninstalled mid-game**, so choose wisely if you want to install this portion.
