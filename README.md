# Septimus-Extended---NPC Dialogue Addon

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integration various mods designed to expand NPC dialogue into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide.

A **NEW SAVE is strongly recommended**. If installing on an existing save, please be sure you have no followers present (modded and/or vanilla), and you have NOT started the Dawnguard questline. 

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - NPC DIALOGUE**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **below all of the Septimus patches**.

## OPTIONAL (FEEL FREE TO SKIP!)

**WARNING** - Relationship Dialogue Overhaul has been known to **potentially cause crashes**. I have included it as an optional file for those who can't live without it (like me!). It's a mod that **cannot be uninstalled mid-game**, so choose wisely if you want to install this portion. There is a small conflict between RDO and Missing Dialogue Edit where you may see double recruitment options for NPCs with supported voice types.

# Last Steps

### Snag the megapatch from here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Dialogue/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Dialogue%20Addon%20v2.0.1.7z) ] ("View raw" button)

Name it **[NoDelete] Septimus Extended - NPC Dialogue Addon**, and place it directly AFTER [NoDelete] [24] Kaidan 2 Extended Edition - Skyrim's Got Talent Patch.

   - If you downloaded **Relationship Dialogue Overhaul**, download the patch from here: **[ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Dialogue/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Dialogue%20Addon%20-%20RDO%20Patch%20v2.0.7z) ] ("View raw" button)**. Name it [NoDelete] Septimus Extended - NPC Dialogue Addon - RDO Patch.

### Then you are SET! Thanks for sticking with it the entire process, enjoy your game!

   - **Currently in the process of testing with version 4.2.1 of Septimus.**
   - **Currently works with the [Septimus-Extended - LOTD Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---LOTD/blob/master/README.md). Load order between the two does not matter.**
   - **A patch for [Septimus Extended - NPC Overhauls Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/README.md) can be found here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Overhauls%20Megapatch%20-%20NPC%20Dialogue%20Patch.7z) ] ("View raw" button). All the mods in that addon need to load AFTER this one on BOTH sides of MO2.**
  
**Load order for the patch is like so;**
   - Septimus
   - Danger Zone
   - NPC Dialogue Addon
   - NPC Dialogue Addon Megapatch
   - NPC Overhaul
   - NPC Overhaul Megapatch
   - NPC Overhaul Megapatch - NPC Dialogue Addon Patch

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Septimus (like from v.4.2.0 to 4.2.1 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire NPC Dialogue addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).
